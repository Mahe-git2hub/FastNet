# FastNet (Not ready for install yet)
API layer built on tf-2.0 for high performance and easy training

# Tenets
- We support only tensorflow 2.x, not 1.x support
- Emphasis on speed of training, when we have to choose between speed and code complexity, we will favor speed.
- Emphasis to build a high level API like Fast.ai on tensorflow
- Self contained but extendable.
- Every function should have proper documentation
- Notebook based examples should be provided
- Enable Multiple Runs and logging for seeing history of experiments.

### Installation

`pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed https://github.com/faizanahemad/FastNet/tarball/master`

or for developer mode:

`pip install -e .`
