# FastNet
API layer built on tf-2.0 for high performance and easy training

# Tenets
- We support only tensorflow 2.x, not 1.x support
- Emphasis on speed of training, when we have to choose between speed and code complexity, we will favor speed.
- Emphasis to build a high level API like Fast.ai on tensorflow
- Self contained but extendable.
